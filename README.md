# DT228B_PYTHON_LAB3
######Python Lab for college

Mobile Device Forensics involves the collection of forensically sound evidence (or admissible evidence that can be presented to the court of law). Using the program you developed in lab 2, find the hash code of the following two files MDF-SF1.docx and MDF-SF2.docx. Since these two files are password protected, write a Python program to break the password. After breaking the password find the hash code again. Compare the values of hash code before and after breaking passwords. List and use two more password management tools for breaking password. Compare the hash codes with those generated by your program.
Make sure that you are program is documented. It is important that your program is uploaded in GitHub as well or any other web based repository service.
